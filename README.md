# HACK Assembler Readme

Please see here my implementation of the Hack Assembler as per the course **Build a Modern Computer from First Principles: From Nand to Tetris (Project-Centered Course)** as available on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/build-a-computer)

Please know that I'm a post grad uni student and technically I've learned Java before (10 years ago), I've only just learned about Object Orientation at uni so if looking through my code you facepalm and wonder why I did things very long winded or time/memory consuming way. Please know I did the best with my current knowledge.

The course is incredibly interesting and rewarding and would recommend anyone take it if they are interested in learning
how computers go from 0's and 1's all the way up to what we all know now. 

Also please know Pong.asm is not mine and Pong.hack is what is created by running Pong.asm through my assembler. Pong.asm
was written by the creators of the Nand to Tetris course using a higher level language and compiled down to Pong.asm
via their compiler. Which I will also be learning to write in the second part of this course.
